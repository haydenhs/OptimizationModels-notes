# OptimizationModels-notes
My notes on the book Optimization Models by G.C. Calafiore and L. El Ghaoui.

For now, only a Chinese version is considered. Maybe notes for the following chapters will be in English.

Note that the math equations may be not correctly viewed on GitHub. It's better to first download the files and open on your laptop using `jupyter notebook`.
